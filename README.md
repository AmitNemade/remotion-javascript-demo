This video is 100% made using JavaScript‚ù§

Hello Guys,

Recently I was watching #NamasteJavascript playlist by Akshay Saini on youtube. While watching one of his video, I got an idea that we can create animated video for explaining the same concept. And being a Javascript developer, I searched on google How to create a video using Javascript. Luckily I found an amazing cool library called Remotion.

Using this library I tried creating animated video to explain How Javascript code gets executed. I had copied the example from the same playlist that I mentioned earlier.

Talking about this library, the basic idea behind Remotion is that it gives us a frame number and a blank canvas, and the freedom to render anything we want using React. In short, we can use our #reactjs skills to create a video. Also when we generate a build of this react project, it exports .mp4 video of specified dimensions

This was my first video that I tried using Remotion library. I really loved using this library and am still exploring all of its features.

I hope you like this video and hope that I am able to explain the concept also.
